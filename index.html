      <h2>[BLOG-01]Your dog may love you, but doesn't love the sight of your face, study finds</h2>

      <p>You may think your dog is excited at the sight of your face, but research published Monday suggests that unfortunately, she probably isn’t.</p>

      <p>The study, in the Journal of Neuroscience, shows that dogs aren’t wired to focus on human faces. What does make their brains spark is the glimpse of another dog. The sight of a human? Not so much.</p> 

      <p>Through MRI scans of humans and dogs watching videos — of both humans and dogs — Hungarian scientists learned that while humans have a specialized brain region that lights up when a face comes into view, dogs do not. Both dogs and humans, however, do have a brain region that sparks when a member of the same species comes into view. </p>

      <p>“Faces are central to human visual communication … and human brains are also specialized for faces,” study co-author Attila Andics, an animal behavior researcher at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, said in an email. But that doesn’t appear to be the case for man’s best friend.</p>

      <p>Dogs do pay attention to human faces, Andics, said. “They read emotions from faces and they can recognize people from the face alone, but other bodily signals seem to be similarly informative to them.”</p>

      <p>In other words, dogs may notice our faces, and even the expressions on them, but they use all sorts of other information, such as body language and voice cues, to tell what we are up to. Humans, on the other hand, value most what they see on a face.</p>

      <p>To see if humans and dogs processed faces the same way, Andics and his colleagues recruited 30 humans and 20 dogs who were family pets. In the experiment, each human and each dog lay in an MRI machine while shown a series of two-second videos: a dog face, the back of a dog’s head, a human face and the back of a human head. The order in which thoe videos were shown varied with each run.</p>

      <p>Getting a dog to lay still in a loud MRI scanner is a challenge in and of itself.</p>

      <p>“They go through a several months-long training,” Andics said. The dogs are taught that “they cannot move during measurements, even a little.” He added that the “trained dogs are happy volunteers in these experiments, not forced or restrained in any way. They can leave the scanner any time if they want.”</p>

      <p>When they analyzed the brain scans, the researchers found visual areas of the humans’ brains lit up far more when a human face was shown compared to the back of a head. Also human brains were more active when a video of a person played than one of a dog. When it came to the dogs, brain activity didn’t change whether a face or the back of a head was viewed. When videos showed a dog, the dogs’ brains were more active than when videos showed a human.</p>

        <h2>[BLOG-02]Researchers find 'Queen of the Ocean' ancient great white shark off Nova Scotia coast</h2>

        <h3>The shark, named Nukumi by researchers, is more than 17 feet long, 3,541 pounds and believed to be about 50-years-old.</h3>

        <p>Researchers off the coast of Nova Scotia found a nearly 2-ton great white shark believed to be roughly 50 years old, dubbing her a true “Queen of the Ocean.”</p>

        <p>Coming in at more than 17 feet long and 3,541 pounds, she is the largest shark the group has been able to sample in the Northwest Atlantic, according to a Friday Facebook post by OCEARCH, a non-profit marine research organization. She’s been named Nukumi for “the legendary wise old grandmother figure” of the Indigenous Mi'kmaq people, a First Nations group native to that region of Canada.</p>

        <p>Chris Fischer, the OCEARCH expedition leader, called Nukumi a “proper Queen of the Ocean” in a video log posted Saturday.</p>

        <p>“She’s probably 50-years-old and certainly her first litters of pups she would have been having 30 years ago are also making babies, really humbling to stand next to a large animal like that,” Fischer said. “When you look at all the healed-over scars and blotches and things that are on her skin, you’re really looking at the story of her life and it makes you feel really insignificant.”</p>

        <p>Great white sharks can live up to at least 60 years, according to the Smithsonian, though scientists are constantly learning new information about the storied predators of the sea. Sharks are among the earth’s oldest living animals.        </p>

        <p>Fossils of a creature believed to be the ancestor of the great white shark, Megalodon, is estimated to have lived more than 20 million years ago. Another shark ancestor, Helicoprion, is believed to have swum the ocean nearly 290 million years ago, the Smithsonian said.</p>

        <p>OCEARCH researchers have been finding and tagging sharks for several days to learn more about the predators. Fischer said in an update posted Monday that they found two additional female great white sharks on Monday, totaling nine that they’ve been able to sample and tag on the nearly monthlong expedition.</p>

        <p>The group is nearing the end of their current expedition, but Fischer called the trip “hugely successful” on “multiple levels.”</p>
